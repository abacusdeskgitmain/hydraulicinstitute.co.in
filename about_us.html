        <td align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#F9F9F9" style="padding-left:15px;"><p class="inner">We, at PHE Institute of Hydraulics  (an initiative of <a href="http://www.phe-india.co.in" target="_blank">Precision Hydraulic Engineers</a>) Faridabad, are providing basic and advanced  training to new and existing personnel in the construction, mobile and industrial  hydraulic industries .We impart a mix of class room and on-the- job work  training for participants to receive full benefits of the programs.</p>
          <p class="inner">&nbsp;The programs feature Basic and Advanced  Certification .Each certification involves successful completion of modules of  classes to provide comprehensive training in basic skill and tools management  to complement technical content of the programs. These also involve practical  sessions in the in house workshop facilities for short-term courses. For ITI&rsquo;s  and Diploma candidates, practical training would be arranged on actual job  sites/ workshops.</p>
          <p class="inner">All technical modules stress upon the following:</p>
          <p class="inner" style="padding-left:15px;"><strong> a</strong>. Basic  principles &nbsp;<strong>b</strong>. Preventive maintenance and <strong>&nbsp;c</strong>. Trouble shooting </p>
<p class="inner">This  PHE Institute of Hydraulics  is an initiative of Precision Hydraulic Engineers Faridabad, this company was established in  August 2000 as a proprietorship company, keeping in mind the vast potential  existing in after-sales-support of Heavy Earthmoving &amp; Construction Equipment.  Our main area of activity is to provide cost effective and durable repair of  hydraulic components fitted on these machines, thanks to our knowledge and  experience in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="inner" >As the country is progressing fast, the basic requirement of  building infra-structures and industrial projects at a brisk pace is the need  of the hour. </p><img src="images/about-i.gif" / align="right" style="margin:20px;">
          <p align="justify" class="inner">Plants and Machineries are vital  part of any of these construction activities to mechanise them in order to  reduce time of completion and also to do the job more efficiently and of better  quality. This results in cost saving, safe and timely completion of jobs. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="inner" >Growth of construction industry  has not only thrown a challenge but also landed in a crisis of sort to get  requisite skilled manpower for day to day operation of works as the same is not  available to man the modern plants and machineries. These plants and  machineries are becoming tech savvy with innovation of new technology each  passing day. Availability of people with adequate skill and know-how required  to operate and maintain these machines is becoming difficult with no source of  generation of skilled people for the specified jobs. </p>
          <p class="inner" >Construction industry has not  been able to visualize this demand and supply gap and is now becoming victim of  the problem and suffering badly. <strong>We, with our long association with the industry, have decided to look for the   solution by setting-up a Technical Institute to impart training in equipment   management, which is a step forward in this direction. We have located PHE Institute of Hydraulics in Gurukul area of Sarai Khawaja in   Faridabad (Haryana).</strong></p>
          <p class="inner">We envisage to enroll unskilled  youth who are not qualified enough, train them and make them skilled workmen  and train to operate different construction equipment to fill the void to the  extent possible, both in organized as well as unorganized sectors of construction  industry. We will also offer add-on courses for the apprentices coming out of Polytechnics  and ITI&rsquo;s enhancing their chance of getting employment. Our proposition is to  provide high quality skilled workforce to operate, maintain and carry-out  quality repair services.</p>
          <p class="inner">Institute will also offer courses  for skill generation, skill development and skill advancement. We would conduct  short-term specialized courses designed as per our customer needs for  operation, maintenance and overall construction equipment management covering  all aspect of project operation. These courses could be further segmented into  different project specific equipment and operations.</p>
          
          <p class="inner"><strong><u>Our Institute will cater basically three segments . </u></strong></p>
          <ol start="1" type="a">
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM&rsquo;s) who have a       large range of construction equipment within a given market but are       lacking a strong Product Support Program.</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Large construction contractors who take-up commercial       construction projects and manage their own fleet of equipment engaged at       various sites and projects.</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Private owners of construction equipment who supply       heavy machineries on rental basis.</li>
          </ol>
         
          <p class="inner" >The training  courses would cover all technical, commercial and safety aspects of plants and  machineries including on-hand practical sessions and would be of the durations  ranging from 7 days, &nbsp;15 days, 3 months  and 6 months depending on the qualification and experience of the candidates.  The candidates would be given a certificate after successful completion of the  courses. Our&rsquo;s is a unique service oriented Institute which will save our  clients expenditures on following fronts.</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Recruitment cost</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Training cost (including un-warranted break-downs which  occur due to un-skilled staff handling the machines)</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">Training time</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">A source of continuous supply of skilled manpower at  all times</li>
            <li class="inner" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 10px;">A safeguard against attrition and heavy poaching prevalent  in the construction industry. </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p class="inner" >We have  generated a pricing structure for imparting training. This cost will be solely  borne by the trainees and companies who want their existing manpower to get  trained. &nbsp;</p>
          <p class="inner">The Institute  will have affiliations with Govtt. Bodies and recognition in due course. The  Institute would recommend successful candidates to various  companies/organizations with whom we have long association and help them get  gainfully employed (though demand is so huge as against supply that  recommendation may not be needed at all).</p>
          <p class="inner">We hope above  explains our idea of technical institute which not only works as stimulus to  the skill development and fill the demand and supply gap to some extent but  also gives an option to the existing customers, equipment owners, OEM&rsquo;s to  cater their needs of skilled manpower.</p></td>
